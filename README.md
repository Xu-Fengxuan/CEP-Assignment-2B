# CEP-Assignment-4
given a spritesheet of 32 by 32 pixel sprites, with water, rock, land (top left, top right, top middle, left middle, right middle, bottom middle, bottom left, botom right and middle tiles), and another sprite sheet of a boat (16 directions e.g. forward, backwards-left), make a procedurally generated ocean map using Wave Function Collapse. The rocks can only be surrounded by water, and islands can be multiple grids large. The boat can be controlled by wasd keys and arrow keys and can travel around the map. The map will be generated in sections of 100 by 100 grids, with more sections generated when the boat reaches close to the edge (20 grids buffer distance) of the already generated sections. The boat should handle multi key presses. After the map generation, gold coins should be generated on water tiles randomly, and the boat can pick up these coins to earn coins. 
make all land tiles have a rippling wave effect rippling outwards, decreasing in thickness and transparency as it travels outwards and dissapearing after travelling a third of a grid's length. the wave should be constructed with sine wave, and the waves of land corner pieces like lamd top right, land top left and land bottom left and right should lengthen on the corner as they expand to ensure the two sine waves of the two sides of the corner pieces remain touching each other as they travel outwards. the waves should also ripple as they travel outwards by making the sine use the p5.js frameCount variable multiplied by a small number so that the sine wave will complete one cycle in 90 frames. the sine wave waves of each land tile should also seamlessly link with the wave generated by the tile next to it, by making the cycle of the wave a multiple of the length of one tile. double check your calculations, logic and code
