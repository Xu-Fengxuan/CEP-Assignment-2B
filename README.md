# CEP-Assignment-4
given a spritesheet of 16 by 16 pixel sprites (will be given in the future), with water, rock, land (top left, top right, top middle, left middle, right middle, bottom middle, bottom left, botom right and middle tiles), and another sprite sheet of a boat (8 directions e.g. forward, backwards-left), make a procedurally generated ocean map using Wave Function Collapse. The rocks can only be surrounded by water, and islands can be multiple grids large. The boat can be controlled by wasd keys and arrow keys and can travel around the map. The map will be generated in sections of 100 by 100 grids, with more sections generated when the boat reaches close to the edge (20 grids buffer distance) of the already generated sections. The boat should handle multi key presses. After the map generation, gold coins should be generated on water tiles randomly, and the boat can pick up these coins to earn coins.
